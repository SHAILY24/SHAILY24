Engineer who builds data pipelines, full-stack applications, and ML systems. Currently open to opportunities.

## What I've Built

**Financial Systems** - Caught a bug that would've cost $3 billion at Credit Suisse. Built systems processing $2-5 billion daily in payments. Reduced margin call creation from 20 minutes to 200ms.

**Government Tech** - Created offline-first encrypted assessment system for Jersey City courts. Zero-downtime migration of 5M+ case records. Helped divert 1000+ people from jail to community service.

**Sports Tech** - Ball tracking at 150+ mph with 95% accuracy for AR golf glasses. Built ML models processing 100M+ sensor data points daily. Cut cloud costs 70% using edge computing.

**B2B Commerce** - Built e-commerce platform generating $2M projected revenue. Integrated 15+ enterprise systems (QuickBooks, Stripe, UPS, etc). Saved 72 person-hours daily through automation.

## Tech Stack

**Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, SQL  
**Frontend**: React, Angular, Vue, Material-UI, D3.js
